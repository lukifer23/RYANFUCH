## Critical Issues & Blockers

### Android Black Screen Issue
**Priority**: HIGH

**Problem Statement:**
Android app loads and runs successfully but displays only a black screen with no menu or game content visible to the user.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **IDENTIFIED**: System UI hiding (`hideSystemUI()`) was preventing menu rendering
- **PARTIALLY FIXED**: Removed UI hiding calls to allow menu display
- **ONGOING**: Menu still not rendering despite successful app initialization

**Debugging Progress:**
1. Fixed system UI hiding issue
2. Added comprehensive logging to MainActivity
3. Verified OpenGL ES version fallback (3.0 → 2.0)
4. Confirmed build system working with Gradle
5. Tested on physical device (Galaxy S25)
6. Investigating menu rendering pipeline

**Next Steps:**
- Investigate MainActivity UI rendering
- Check touch event handling
- Verify GLSurfaceView rendering pipeline
- Test with different Android devices
- Review activity lifecycle management

**Impact:**
- Blocks Android port completion
- Prevents user testing and feedback
- Delays multi-platform release
